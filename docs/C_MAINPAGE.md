# YAI Specs API (Contracts)

These docs are generated from the normative headers in `specs/protocol/` and `specs/vault/`.
They describe the public ABI and wire contracts that consumers must obey.

Quick links:
- `specs/protocol/`
- `specs/vault/`
- `specs/control/`

Normative note:
If runtime code disagrees with these specs, the code is wrong.
