# YAI Law Documentation

`docs/` contains informative documentation for `yai-law`.

This directory helps readers navigate, interpret, and consume the canonical law surfaces defined elsewhere in the repository. It does not redefine normative contracts.

## Purpose

Artifacts under `docs/` are documentation-first and informative.

They exist to:

* explain repository structure
* support generated documentation flows
* point readers to canonical indexes and policy documents
* improve navigation across the law surface

If documentation conflicts with a canonical artifact elsewhere in the repository, the canonical artifact prevails.

## Canonical indexes

Primary repository indexes live at the root:

* `../SPEC_MAP.md`
* `../REGISTRY.md`
* `../VERSIONING.md`
* `../COMPATIBILITY.md`

## Primary documents in this directory

* `C_MAINPAGE.md` — Doxygen entry page
* `pointers/SPEC_MAP.pointer.md` — pointer to the canonical map
* `policy/README.md` — documentation policy for this repository

## Normative source domains

Normative source domains live outside `docs/`:

* `../authority/`
* `../foundation/`
* `../runtime/`
* `../contracts/`
* `../registry/`
* `../schema/`
* `../formal/`
* `../packs/`
* `../vectors/`

## Interpretation rule

`docs/` supports law consumption.
It is not the origin of repository authority.
