# Formal Artifacts

This directory holds optional outputs from formal verification runs (e.g., TLC state snapshots).
These artifacts are not normative. They may be committed only when needed to support a
specific analysis or review.

## Policy
- Treat artifacts as optional snapshots.
- Prefer small, named captures tied to a specific issue or claim.
- If a snapshot is committed, include context in the commit message and/or a brief note in
  the relevant formal README.
